pyfunc is a graph library that will plot functions on an x/y scale.

Usage: pyfunc [-d<dimensions>] [-x|y<x or y-axis scale>] arg1[, arg2, etc]

Options:

    -c, --colors:
        A comma-separated list of hex color values to use for each curve. The
        values will be rotated through; using just one value will use the same
        color for each curve. E.g., "-cffffff,ffdddd,336699" or "-cffffff".

    -d, --dimensions:
        Indicates the dimensions of the window that opens. Should be specified
        with the following format: <width>x<height>, e.g.: "400x400".

    -x, -y:
        Specifies the scale of the graph in given direction (x axis, or y
        axis). Uses the format <from>x<to>, for example to make a graph that
        extends from -5 to 5 on the x axis and 0 to 1.5 on y, use:
        "-x-5x5 -y0x1.5"

Functions:
    The python math library is available to use in functions. Most functions
    should be quoted on the command line to prevent bash from attempting to
    parse it. One special case is when the function starts with negative x -
    the command line argument parser assumes it as a switch and will fail. To
    work around this, use something like "0-x" or "(-x)".

Examples:

    $ python pyfunc x
    $ python pyfunc -y0x5 "abs(x)"
    $ python pyfunc --colors=336699,ffffee,990000,009900 --dimensions=800x600 -x-5x10 -y-5x10 x -x x**2 "5-x**2"

Cool Examples (args only):
    "x*sin(10*x)" x -x
    -x0x5 "ln(x)*cos(15*x)" "ln(x)" "-ln(x)"
    "sin(954*x)-2*cos(x)"
    "sin(tan(x)/x)" "cos(tan(x)/x)"
